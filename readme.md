# 3x3 Crypto Chart

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript-based web page that displays a 3x3 table with cryptocurrency data, including the current Bitcoin price and 24-hour percentage change.

## Features

- Fetches the current Bitcoin price from the CoinDesk API and displays it in the table.
- Calculates and displays the 24-hour percentage change for the Bitcoin price.
- Updates the Bitcoin price and percentage change every minute.
- Includes a basic table layout with styling.

## Usage

1. Save the following HTML code in a file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>3x3 Chart</title>
  <style>
    /* CSS styles go here */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Crypto</h1>
  <table id="crypto-table">
    <tr>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Percentage</th>
      <th>Quality</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BTCUSDT</td>
      <td id="bitcoin-percentage">-</td>
      <td id="bitcoin-price">-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NEARUSDT</td>
      <td>Row 2, Col 2</td>
      <td>Row 2, Col 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SANDUSDT</td>
      <td>Row 3, Col 2</td>
      <td>Row 3, Col 3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <script>
    /* JavaScript code goes here */
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the 3x3 crypto chart.

## Customization

- **Table Layout**: Modify the HTML table structure to add, remove, or rearrange the rows and columns.
- **Table Styling**: Update the CSS styles to change the appearance of the table, such as the colors, font, and borders.
- **Data Sources**: Modify the JavaScript code to fetch data from different APIs or use static data instead.
